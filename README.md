# Proof Specimen

Where we can sort proofs into categories based on the proof techniques we think are well-equipped to solve them.

As we develop our algorithm, we can test it out on these proofs.

## Current categories

Some proof techniques include:
- *Forward-Reasoning from Target*: Proofs where forward-reasoning from the target is genuinely helpful.
- *Generalization - Specialization*: Proofs where applying generalization & specialization is genuinely helpful.
- *Induction*: Proofs where applying mathematical induction (or, thought of slightly differently, an algorithm) is genuinely helpful.
- *Library Search*: Proofs where a sophisticated library search has to be used.
- *Oscillation*:  Proofs where oscillating between counterexamples, lemmas-learnt-from-failure, and the proof is genuinely helpful.

Of course some proofs may fall in multiple categories, at which point it might make sense for the full proof to be stored in a folder belonging to a particular category, and for the high-level summary of why it is relevant to each category to still be written down in every relevant category.
