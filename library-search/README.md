# Library Search

_Proofs where a sophisticated library search has to be used._

# A continuous bijection from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism

*High-level:* 
- I remember we mentioned this proof can be done almost entirely with library search.  
- I also remember we said that at points in the theorem, when we try to generalize to find shortest paths, we might be tempted to solve some silly theorems e.g. “every open subset is compact” and “every open subset is closed”.  So, this theorem brings up questions about the procedure we use to make the computer realize it can’t prove these statements.  In particular, perhaps we want to make sure library search is strong enough that we never get to this point.

*Details* TBD.
