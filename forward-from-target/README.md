# Forward-reasoning from target

_Proofs where forward-reasoning from the target helps proof discovery._

### In any n-vertex graph where each vertex’s degree is at least n/2, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle.

*High-level:* 
- As it turns out, the prevailing way to do it (i.e. the way Tim learned it in school, and the way it seems textbooks prove it), involves breaking it up into
	- 1) Proving there exists a Hamiltonian path.
	- 2) Proving the first and last vertices of that path are neighbours.
- That is, when someone solves it, they have to forward-reason from the target and say “well, if there’s a Hamiltonian cycle, then there’s definitely a Hamiltonian path.”

*Details* TBD.

### Cars on a racetrack

There are n cars on a circular track.  Adding up the gas in their tanks, there’s enough to get around the track exactly once.  Show there exists a car that can complete one lap by collecting gas from the others on its way around.

*High-level:* 
- I reasoned forward from the target in this way: “Well, if there is a car that can make it all the way around, then there’s definitely a car that can make it to the next car.”
- And once I had proven that lemma, I could use it to “shrink” the size of the racetrack in an inductive argument.

### Does there exist a non-abelian group whose subgroups are all normal?

*High-level:* 
- Tim uses forward-reasoning from target to deduce a bunch of properties that must be satisfied for such a group.   
- In particular, he finds that such a group must have size at least 8.
	- can’t be a dihedral group…
	- can’t be abelian…so there must be 2 elements that don’t commute…and so then the subgroup generated by a and b will still be non-abelian, because a and b still don’t commute
	- so make that your new group (this will be the smallest possible counterexample.). so that again whittles down the size of the search space — now you can just consider groups with only 2 generators.
- So you can filter out a bunch of things while doing a brute force search, or Tim says, “whittle things down with necessary conditions”
- there were parameterizations there
	- a is what power of  b
	- b is what power of a
	- then prove stuff about the powers
- then parameterize by “position in list of smallest possible counterexamples” and minimize that — find smallest possible counterexample.
